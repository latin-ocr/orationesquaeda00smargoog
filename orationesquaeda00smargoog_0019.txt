About this timu Cesar Octavius arrived in Rome, from Appol-
lonis, ond hod an interview with Cicero. Their meeting was of n
friendly ohan-neten ond it was agreed, thst they should use
every exertion to promote their mutual interest. Cicero was
prevailed on the more resdily to adopt suoh' mensures, in ’

boys, os he imogined, the sons of Senators, to the capitol, because
Jupiter designed to pitch upon one of them sor sovereign of Rome.
When they appeared, Octavius was chosen.- A voice was heard, ,
as he imngined in his dream, proclsming the following remsrknble
words: ί Romans, this is the person who, when he comes ω be your
prinae, will put on end to your civil wars! This vision, as is
reported, mode such owimpression on Cicero, thot he distinotly
retained the appearance of the huy, though he hnd never yet seen
him. On the following day he went to the Campus Martius,
when the boys wem just returning from their exercises, and, to his
surprise, the first one that met his eye, wns the very lad thet he
had seen in his dream. Astonished at the discovery, Cicero in-
quired who he wns, sud ever afterwards treated him with great
kindnoes.

This dream, together with the circumstance of his being born
the same year thot Cicero wus consul, were* the pretended reasons
os their connexion. It was supposed, however, by many, that the
true cause, on Cicero's part, was his hunred ofAntony, und his
nmb' ¹ n to mke an active port in the sdministrntion of the
waidemro’eglssiowen ot minime, wns st its greatest height. He ex-
pelled Antony5ond raised such u spu-:t of oppositioni against him,
thot the consuls, Hirtius sud Pansa, were sent to give him battle.
He likewise prevoiled with the Senate to grant Ocuvius thefoeccr,
with the ‹lignity of From-,as one thot was fighting ior his country.

When the two armies met, Antony lost the day, but both the
consuls fell in the engagement. After the aetion, the troo s of
Hirtius and Panse, rnnged themselves under the banners of cta- ’
vius. But the Sennte, ninid of the views os so young s mun, fa-
voured hy fortune, as he was, endeavoured ω druw his foro·- from
him. They insisted that es Antony was put to ssight, there was no
need to keep such an army on foot. Alnrmed at their mensures, Oc-
tavius sent some stiends to entrent Cicero ω prooure the consulship

and suffered himself to he imposed upon by his duplioit .

But it was not long before he found his mistnke. ctevius no
monor obmiued his object, clun he gnve np Cicero, and reconciling
himself with Annony and Lepidus, divided the empire with them,
