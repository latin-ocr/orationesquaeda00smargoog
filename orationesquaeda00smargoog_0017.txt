he says, ¹ Whither shall 1 turn? Pompey has the more honourable

and is most able meave himself, and his friends. ln short, 1 know
whom to avoid, hut not whom to seek! A friend of Cnsar's, at
length, whose name was Tribatius, wrote to him, that Caesar
thought he had reason ω consider him as a friend, and intended to
treat him as a parmer of his hopes* Cicero was surprised that
Cesar should have employed anotlier to write on so important
a subject, and answered indignantly, that he would do nothing
unworthy of his olitieal character.

When Gasar, owever, marched for Spain, Cicero repaired to
Pompey. On his arrival, Cam rebuked him for the steps he had
taken. ‘As for me,’ said Cato, ‘it would have been wrong to

adopted, or his plan of conducting the war.

Cicero was not present at the battle of Pharsalia, in consequence
ot*- indisposition. After that event, he was requested by Cato to
take the command of a large body of forces that lay at Darrychium.
But he deelined entirely to have any thing more to do with the

his friends, charged him with being a traitor to his country, and
would, in all probability, have dispatehed him, ir Cato had not in-

repaired to Brundusium to meet caesar on his return from Egypt.
Connary to expectation, however, Caesar lauded at Tarentum.
When Cicero was apprised of this, he set out for his camp. Caesar
