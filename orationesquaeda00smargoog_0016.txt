quest. Clodius, shortly afterwards, was elected tribune, and, ns
might he expected, determined ω ruin Cicero. He secured the
favour oi* the people, hy indulging their wishes3 and the consuls,
by decreeing them the government of large und wealthy pro-
vinces. Cesar was now about to set out on his expedition to Gaul.
Cicero, to avoid the fury of Clodius, applied to he taken along '
with him os his lieuoemnt, which was reedily granted. Clodius
perceiving, thet by this means Cicero would escape his muge-nce,
pretended to be anxious cor a reconciliation, und succeeded so ἦν
as to prevail on Cicero to loy oside nl] thoughts of his expedition.
Czsar was so much offended that he alienated Pompey entirely
from his interest. Nur did he stop here; but declus-ed openly
before the people, that he had been guilty of o gross violation of
justice, in pntting Cethegus and Lentulus to death, without any

in these exertions. A decree was psssed for his restoration with

· charge, was the bringing of Cappadocia to submit to king Ario-
burmann which he nccomplished by pacific mensures, to the
entire satisfmtiun οἱ all parties. During the whole time ul his
administration in Cappadocia, he acted with great circumspec-
tion. He ehecked the commotionis that were raised in Syria,
in consequence of the miscarriage or the Roman army in Par-
thia. No presente were received by him from the neighbour-
