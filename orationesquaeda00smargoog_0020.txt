as if it had been a rivate estate3 and, in order ψ aeeomplish their
object, proscribes about two hundred os those who appeared to
stand most in their way. But the greatest difficulty was ω deter-
mine how to dispose of Cicero. Antony would come to no terms
till he was taken off. Lepidus agreed with Antony3 but Oem-
vius opposed them both. To settle this point, they had a private
me'eting at Bononia, which lasted three days. During the two
first, Octavius plead for Cicero, but on the third he gave him up.
The tei-ms on which they agreed were, that Octavius should aban-
don Cicero to his fate ς Lepidus, his brother Paulus3 and Antony,
⁴ Lucius Cesar, his maternal uncle.

While these proeeedings were in operation, Cicero was at his
Tusculau villa3 but, on hearing what was done, he removed to
Astyra, his country seat. Astyra was near the sea, and Cicero, on
his arrival, found a vessel at the shore, in which he embarked,
and soon landed at Cir-omum. Here he lest the sea and travelled to-
wards Rome a hundred furlongs, ou root. Repenting, however, οἱ
what he had done, he again made for the sea, but was still unde-
cided as to what he should do. At last, he put himself in the hands
ot* his servants, and ordered them to carry him to cajeta by wa-
ter, where he had arrived but a short time when the assassins came
up. Their commendem wereflierennius, acenturion, aud Pon.-
pilius, a tribune, whomCicero had formerly defended, when under
a prosecution for parricide. The deora were broken open, but
Cicero did uot appear. The servants who were found said they
knew nothing about him; but a young man, named Phil s,
informed the tribune that they were carrying him by a oon aled
path toward the sea, upon which he took a few soldiets anfi ran
to iutercept their passage. Cicero, no sooner pereeived what
was done, than he ordered his servan& to set down the litter.
When the party earne up, he looked them fun in the face,
then putting his head out of the litter, Herennius gave him the
fatal blow. His head and hands were eut off, and brought tn Rome
by the command ol' Antuny3 who uo sooner saw them, theu he

’ cried out ί Now let there be an end ot* all proseriptions,’ then
ordered them m be sasteued up over the rostra.

Thus fell uicem, in the sixty-sourth year of his age; a man to
whom his country was much indebted sor his eminent services.
As a patriot‚ none stood higher, and‘none had more the publio
good at heart, or aeted from purer motives. With him fell
the libel-ties of Rome ς and if his mensures were not all diented by
the wisest policy, they were dietsted by oue who was a ffiend to
his country, when but few appeared dieinterestedly in its desence.
