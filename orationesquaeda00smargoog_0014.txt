When Cicero had attained a knowledge os the elementary
brancha of educotion, he attended the lectores of Philo, the Aca-
demioian, the disciple of Clitomachus, who was then at Rome.
About the same time, he studied law with Mucius Sctevola, one

« of the ablest of the Roman advocates, ahd shortly afterwards made

his first appearance at the bar. The cause in which he was em-
ployed on that occasion was well calculated m exhibit the powers οἰ
the young orator ω great advantage. Sylla had ordered the estate
of une who had fallen a victim ω his cruelty, to be sold annotina,
The purchaser was a freedman of Sylla, whose name was Chry-
sogonus, snd the price two thousand drachmae, s sum far below its
vulue- These proceedings were highly resented by Roscius, the
son of the deceased, who hesitated not to say that it was worth
two hundred and fisty talentu. To hsve his conduct thus ublicly
censured, was more than Sylla felt dis osed to bear, andl imme-
diately entered a prosecution against oscius for the murder os
his father. Roscius, by this circumstance, was brought into seri-
ous danger5 for such was the dread of Sylls’s cruelty that no oue
dared to appear as his advocate. In this predicament he a plied
to Cicero, who was prevailed on by his friends to undem e his
defenee, in which he succeeded in such a way os to equal their
most sanguine expecmtions.

But this glory was not achieved without considerable hazard,
and Cicero, m save himself, lest Rome and sought an asylum at
Athens, where he heard the lectures of Antiochus the Ascalonite,
with whose grweful manner and easy fluw of eloquence he
was highly delighted. From ·Athens he went to Asia, ond
availed himself οἵ the instructions ol Xenocles os Adramyttium,
Dionyssius of Magnesia, and Meni pus of caria„ He next visited
Rhodes, where he attended on ppollonius the son ol' Molo, a.
rhetorician oi* great eminence, and Posidonius the Philosopher.

rose to the highest standing at the bar. The first public office m
which he was appointed, was the quastorship of Sinum and in
the discharge of its duties, acted with so much equity and circurn-

the fact of their applying to him, shortly afterwards, to advocate
their cause in* the prosecution os Verres. It is not necessary
at present, nor do our limits admit, that we should follow him
through an the grades of advancemeut to the consulship. It is
sufficient to say, that whatever office he filled his character was
still the same for justice and moderation. In his furty-third year
he was elected consul. His competitur was the celebrated Cati-
line, whose elaims were urged with great eogerness by himself
