was of 1111 the meniu Rome, best calculated to take the leod in such

’ escape the observafion of Cicero, by whom they were com-
pletely frustrated, ond whose activity on the occasion, was
rewarded with the highest encomiums. Public thanks were de-
creed tu him by the Senate. A public thanksgiving was also
decreed in his name, in honour of the gods, because, by him the
city had been preserved froin conflagration, the citizens from
mnssacre, and Italy from wnr. This was the more flattering, in

Among those who espoused the cause of Cicero during the
conspiracy οἰ Cotiline, was the celebrated Publius Clodius. His
adventure in the house os Cesar, and his violation of the ri hts of
the goddess Bona, are too well known toneed repetition: ιιι-1113
