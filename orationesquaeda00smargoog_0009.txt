To facilitate the acquisitinn ol* knowledge, eonstitutes
the most prominent feature in nur present system of edu-
catiou. Every thing calculated to impede the scholar
has been laid aside, and the sources of'insormation su
. opened, that study becomes a pleasure rather than a
task. In no part o? education havevthe effecte of im-
provement been mure obvious, than in the attuinment
of a correct knowledge os thc- Latin and Greek lunguages.
For a long time it was a matter of just complaint, that the
notes which were written upon difficolt palssagae in the
ancient elassics3 and, which, when rightly understood,
were calculated to give the reader cot-rect views ο(
the nuthcr's meaning, were written in Latin of a pecu-
liar kind, osten more difficult tn be understood than the
text itsels. Is the present edition of Cicero's Orations
should be found to remove these difficulties, the editor
will consider himself as fully repaid sor his labour.

The compilers of the nutes in the Dauphin editions οἰ ’
the classics, took great care tn·collect a mass os usesul
information, and many of their notes and observations are
os such impurtance asto merit the attention of the student.
But, as they have hitherto appeared, that which was

· intended to aid the scholar is of no advantage to him.
This was a difficulty that could not be entirely remedied
hythe use nl* dictioni-im the variety of significatione,
of which many words are susceptible, and οἱ which, nn
enumeration is always indispensible in a lexicon, osten
perplexed the scholar and rendered a short explanatory
note desirable: We need say nothing of the advantages
