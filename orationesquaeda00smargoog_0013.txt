OF

M. T. CICERO.

M. Τ, CICERO was horu nt Arpinum, on the third day οἰ
sanum, Α. U. G. 648, one hundred und xix years before the
Christian ern. Oi· his parenmge', we know but little. His mother,
whose name was Helvia, was a wonnu uf unblemished reputat-ion,
and of noble descent. Among his pater-nol uncesum was Attius
Tullus, n prince uf the Vulsci, who, by the wisdom* and equity
of his government‚ obtained great popularity with the people over
whom he reigned.

Of the origin of the name, there are different accounts. Pliny
supposes, that some one of the family was firs‘t called Cicero from

· his occupatiori, the culture o( vetches. But due more generally
received opinionis, thet the name was given in consequence of an
excreeence, that grew on the face of one of his predecessore, in
the form or a vetch. Cicem was one of those genium thot gave
early indication of future greamess, aud when n boy was remu-k-
able sor his industry and attainments. Poetry was, at first, his
favour-ite study3 but it was not cultivated to the neglect of any os
the more ucel'ul branches of education. At the age of seventeen,
he wrote a poem called Pontius Glnueun but which, like ull his
other poeticnl compositius-s, except n few fragments, is lost.

Of his character as a poet, Plutarch speaks with approbation3
but whether he had much merit in this respect, is doubtful. Ju-
venal and sume omem, who were better judges of Latin poetry,
have expresse-1 very different opinions.

It was in another field that Cicero's powers were to unfold theth*
selvas. Before his tirue, eloquence had not been much atudied
at Rome, and the palm of victory was granted, with general con-
sent, to the Greeks. Great effectu, it is true, had osten been
produced, by their oratore, both in tl· senate and in the assem-
blies uf the Roman eople. But their style was not that which
would please an enlig tened und polished nudienee3 nur hul any ol*
them made the gmces os oratory a subject of particular stu-ly.
Cicero wu the finst who united elegance os diction, and propriety
οἳ muner, with the force of energy and persuasion.
