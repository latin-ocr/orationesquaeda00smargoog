ADVERTISEM'ENT.

In presenting ω the publi'e n second edition of Cleeru's
Orations with English nutes, the Publishers recl n plenam-e

Dauphin editions or this work3 which they trust has been Ι,

by the reader, and some exn-acts (rom Duum and other
Commentators, are occasionallytto be met with, while some

⁴ ol* the notes in the Dnuphin editions have been left out

where they did not appear to be of any material advantage
ῑο the student. It was their prineipal des-ign to publish
un edition οἵ Cicero’s Orations sor the use of schoola.
They have, therefore, omitted many things which they
would have introduced undet· other cimumstnncee‚ but

’ which, in n school book, would have been of no advnnhge,
